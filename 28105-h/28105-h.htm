<h4><a name = "intro" id = "intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>

<p><i>A Learned Dissertation on Dumpling</i> and its <i>Key</i>
(<i>Pudding and Dumpling Burnt to Pot</i>) are typical satiric pamphlets
which grew out of the political in-fighting of the first half of the
eighteenth century. The pamphlets are distinguished by the fact that the
author’s level of imagination and writing makes them delightful reading
even today. In <i>Dumpling</i> the author displays a considerable
knowledge of cooks and cookery in London; by insinuating that to love
dumpling is to love corruption, he effectively and amusingly achieves
satiric indirection against a number of political and social targets,
including Walpole. The <i>Key</i> is in many ways a separate pamphlet in
which Swift is the central figure under attack after his two secret
visits to Walpole during 1726. <i>Dumpling</i> had a long life for an
eighteenth-century pamphlet and was published as late as 1770. Dr.
F.&nbsp;T. Wood has even suggested that it may have influenced Lamb’s
<i>Dissertation on Roast Pig</i>;<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id =
"tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> readers might wish to test this for
themselves.</p>

<p><i>Dumpling</i> and its <i>Key</i> were first claimed for Henry Carey
by Dr. Wood (<ins class = "correction" title = "no space">pp.
442-447</ins>). Carey (1687-1743) is generally thought to have been an
illegitimate scion of the powerful Savile family,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag2" id = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a> with whose name he christened
three of his sons. He was perhaps best known as a writer of songs.
&ldquo;Sally in our Alley&rdquo; is a classic, and he has even a tenuous claim to
the authorship of the English national anthem. Carey’s <i>Dramatic
Works</i> appeared in 1743, the year in which he met his death, almost
certainly by his own hand. Several of the plays were successful and
particular reference should be made to the burlesques
<i>Chrononhotonthologos</i> (1734) and <i>The Dragon of Wantley</i>
(1737). The latter even outran the performances of <i>The Beggar’s
Opera</i> in its first year. Not only do these plays show Carey’s
satiric bent, but so also do a considerable number of his poems. In
1713, 1720, and 1729 Carey published three different collections of his
poetry, each entitled <i>Poems on Several Occasions</i>. Although a few
of the poems were repeated, almost always revised, each edition is very
much a different collection. An edition was brought out in this century
by Dr. Wood.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href =
"#note3">3</a></p>

<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
<!-- png 04 -->
<p>I am strongly inclined to support Carey’s claim to the authorship of
<i>Dumpling</i> and its <i>Key</i> despite Dr. E.&nbsp;L. Oldfield’s
more recent attempt to invalidate it.<a class = "tag" name = "tag4" id =
"tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> There were at least ten editions of
<i>Dumpling</i> in the eighteenth century. The first seven (1726-27)
appeared during Carey’s life, and these (I&nbsp;have seen all but the
third) contain the <i>Namby Pamby</i> verses which later appeared under
Carey’s own name in his enlarged <i>Poems on Several Occasions</i>
(1729). There was also a &ldquo;sixth edition&rdquo; of <i>Dumpling</i> (really the
eighth extant edition) in Carey’s own name published &ldquo;for T.&nbsp;Read,
in Dogwell-Court, White-Friars, Fleet-Street, MDCCXLIV.&rdquo; Though <i>Namby
Pamby</i> was not added to the first edition of the <i>Key</i>, it
appears in the second edition. Both editions were published by Mrs.
Dodd, of whom Dr. Oldfield says: she &ldquo;seems to have been a neighbour,
and known to Carey&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;375). Dr. Wood indicates that &ldquo;at the foot
of a folio sheet containing Carey’s song <i>Mocking is Catching</i>,
published in 1726, the sixth edition of <i>A&nbsp;Learned Dissertation
on Dumpling</i> is advertised as having been lately published&rdquo;
(p.&nbsp;442). Dr. Wood adds in a footnote that this song &ldquo;appeared in
<i>The Musical Century</i> (1740) under the title <i>A&nbsp;Sorrowful
Lamentation for the Loss of a Man and No Man</i>.&rdquo; Even more striking
would seem to be the fact that although there are ninety-one entries in
his <i>Poems</i> (1729), Carey has placed the <i>Sorrowful
Lamentation</i> directly adjacent to <i>Namby Pamby</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Wood maintains of <i>Dumpling</i> that &ldquo;the general style bears a
close resemblance to that of the prefaces to Carey’s plays and
collections of poetry&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;443). I&nbsp;should like strongly to
support his statement. Dr. Oldfield says that an inviolable regard for
decency &ldquo;is nowhere contradicted in Carey’s
works&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yet the pamphlets, besides being
palpably Whiggish, are larded <i>passim</i> with vulgarity of the
‘Close-Stool’ and ‘Clyster’ variety&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;376). The reader need look
no further than <i>Namby Pamby</i> to see that Carey satisfies Northrop
Frye’s very proper observation: &ldquo;Genius seems to have led practically
every great satirist to become what the world calls obscene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for the pamphlets being &ldquo;palpably Whiggish,&rdquo; the reader will not
look far into the allegory before he realizes that one of the central
attacks is against those well-known Whigs Walpole and Marlborough and
their appetite for Dumpling (i.e.,
<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
<!-- png 05 -->
bribery and perquisites). Furthermore, the attack on Swift, which is
central to the <i>Key</i>, is based on the very real fear that the
Dean’s two recent private interviews with Walpole might presage a return
to that leader’s Whig party in exchange for Dumpling. The last pages of
the <i>Key</i> (pp.&nbsp;28-30) deal with the possibility of an
accommodation between Swift and Walpole which is, I&nbsp;feel sure, the
main target of attack. In his poems (<i>Poems</i>, ed. Wood,
pp.&nbsp;83, 86, 88, and <i>passim</i>) Carey claims to stand between
Whig and Tory, just as he does in the pamphlets (<i>Dumpling</i>,
p.&nbsp;1, and <i>Key</i>, p.&nbsp;15 and <i>passim</i>).</p>

<p>Dr. Wood perceptively points to two parallels between <i>Dumpling</i>
and the satiric <i>Of Stage Tyrants</i> (1735) which Carey openly
addressed to the Earl of Chesterfield. <i>Dumpling’s</i> &ldquo;O&nbsp;Braund,
my Patron! my Pleasure! my Pride&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;[ii]) becomes:
&ldquo;O&nbsp;Chesterfield, my patron and my pride&rdquo; (<i>Poems</i>, ed. Wood,
p.&nbsp;104). The passage which follows, dealing with &ldquo;all the
Monkey-Tricks of Rival Harlequins&rdquo; (<i>Dumpling</i>, p.&nbsp;[ii]),
becomes:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Prefer pure nature and the simple scene</p>
<p>To all the monkey tricks of Harlequin</p>
<p class = "center">
(<i>Poems</i>, ed. Wood, p. 106).</p>
</div>

<p>Even more striking is a passage in the <i>Key</i>: &ldquo;Mr. B[ooth] had
spoken to Mr. W[ilks] to speak to Mr. C[ibber] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;
(p.&nbsp;111). This is similar to the following lines in <i>Stage
Tyrants</i>:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Booth ever shew’d me friendship and respect,</p>
<p>And Wilks would rather forward than reject.</p>
<p>Ev’n Cibber, terror to the scribbling crew,</p>
<p>Would oft solicit me for something new</p>
<p class = "center">
(<i>Poems</i>, ed. Wood, p. 104).</p>
</div>

<p>What is particularly impressive is that Carey not only refers to the
three managers of Drury Lane but mentions them in the same order and as
bearing the same relationship to himself. Several highly topical
theatrical allusions in the pamphlets, by which the works can be dated,
accord closely to the life, views, and writings of Carey. All three
managers of Drury Lane were subscribers to Carey’s <i>Poems on Several
Occasions</i> (1729), which
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
<!-- png 06 -->
was dedicated to the Countess of Burlington, who (like the Earl of
Chesterfield) was closely related to Carey’s putative family. In the
<i>Poems</i> these people and many others (including Pope) would have
seen <i>Namby Pamby</i> under Carey’s name and drawn the obvious
conclusion that <i>Namby Pamby</i>, <i>Dumpling</i> and the <i>Key</i>
were by the same author.</p>

<p>We have already seen how closely <i>Dumpling</i> and <i>Stage
Tyrants</i> can be tied together; the reader can compare for himself
that part of <i>Namby Pamby</i> containing &ldquo;So the Nurses get by
Heart&nbsp;/ Namby Pamby’s Little Rhymes,&rdquo; with the passage from the
<i>Key</i>: &ldquo;It was here the D[ean] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. got together all his
Namby Pamby .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from the old Nurses thereabouts&rdquo;
(<i>Key</i>, pp.&nbsp;16-17).</p>

<p>There exists in the Bodleian an early copy of <i>Namby Pamby</i>
(1725?) &ldquo;By Capt. Gordon, Author of the Apology for Parson Alberony and
the Humorist.&rdquo; The joke here is surely in not only letting the Whig
Gordon attack the Whig Ambrose Phillips but then, also by association,
connecting Gordon’s name with the attack on Walpole and Marlborough.
There is a parallel to this: Carey’s &ldquo;Lilliputian Ode on Their Majesties
Succession&rdquo; appeared in <i>Poems</i> (1729), separated from the pieces
previously mentioned by only one short patriotic stanza. Yet in the
Huntington Library there is an almost identical version (1727) which was
ostensibly published by Swift.</p>

<p>The first six editions of <i>Dumpling</i> appeared in 1726 and both
editions of the <i>Key</i> are dated 1727. Apart from the dates on the
title page, this can be verified externally by the initial entries in
Wilford’s <i>Monthly Catalogue</i> (1723-30) of February 1726 and April
1727 respectively. Swift’s first return visit to England (in March 1726
after twelve years) was subsequent to the publication of
<i>Dumpling</i>; his second visit was in the same month as the
publication of the <i>Key</i>, which assigns him <i>ex post facto</i>
the authorship &ldquo;from Page 1. to Page 25.&rdquo; of <i>Dumpling</i>
(<i>Key</i>, p.&nbsp;ix).</p>

<p>Sir John Pudding and his Dumpling are manipulated throughout these
pamphlets to carry a multiplicity of meaning which brings them almost as
close to symbolism as they are to the allegory that Carey claims to be
writing (<i>Key</i>, pp.&nbsp;18, 24 and 29). Collation of
<i>Dumpling</i> with its <i>Key</i> clearly reveals (with due allowance
for satiric arabesque) a&nbsp;series of allegories moving backwards and
forwards through history. At various
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
<!-- png 07 -->
stages, Sir John Pudding (ostensibly Brawn [or John Brand], the famous
cook of the Rummer in Queen Street who appears in Dr. King’s <i>Art of
Cookery</i> [1708]), becomes identifiable with King John, Sir John
Falstaff, Walpole, Marlborough, and even Queen Anne (for the change in
sexes see <i>Key</i>, p.&nbsp;18). All of these enjoyed Dumpling, and
their tastes are ostensibly approved while at the same time being
heavily undercut with satiric indirection. Naturally enough, Walpole
(although a Dumpling Eater) is treated with considerable circumspection.
Carey has warned us that he is a bad chronologist (<i>Key</i>,
p.&nbsp;21), and the Sir John Pudding (be he Walpole or Marlborough [d.
1722]), who at the end of <i>Dumpling</i> is referred to as &ldquo;the Hero of
this DUMPLEID,&rdquo; is for good reason spoken of in the past tense.</p>

<p>The fable of Dumpling, in the true spirit of <i>lanx satura</i>,
allows Carey to attack by indirection a complete spectrum of traditional
eighteenth-century targets. Like the musician and the satirist that he
is, he builds up to a magnificent crescendo (pp.&nbsp;19-24 of his
&ldquo;Dumpleid&rdquo;) which results in one of the finest displays of sustained
virtuosity in early eighteenth-century pamphlet writing.</p>

<p>The notes which follow the texts point to a number of the
contemporary allusions, but the reader will surely wish to recognize
some of the references and the more delicate ironies for himself. As the
author puts it on page 17 of <i>Dumpling</i>:</p>

<p>O wou’d to Heav’n this little Attempt of Mine may stir up some
<i>Pudding-headed Antiquary</i> to dig his Way through all the mouldy
Records of Antiquity, and bring to Light the Noble Actions of Sir
<i>John</i>!</p>

<span class = "firstword">he</span> Dumpling-Eaters are a Race sprung
partly from the old <i>Epicurean</i>, and partly from the <i>Peripatetic
Sect</i>; they were brought first into <i>Britain</i> by <i>Julius
Cesar</i>; and finding it a Land of Plenty, they wisely resolv’d never
to go Home again. Their Doctrines are Amphibious, and compos’d <i>Party

<i>Peripatetics</i>, they derive their Principle

of Walking, as a proper Method to digest a Meal, or create an Appetite;
from the <i>Epicureans</i>, they maintain that all Pleasures are
comprehended in good Eating and Drinking: And so readily were their
Opinions embrac’d, that every Day produc’d many Proselytes; and their
Numbers have from Age to Age increas’d prodigiously, insomuch that our
whole Island is over-run with them, at present. Eating and Drinking are
become so Customary among us that we seem to have entirely forgot, and
laid aside the old Fashion of Fasting: Instead of having Wine sold at
Apothecaries Shops, as formerly, every Street has two or three Taverns
in it, least these Dumpling-Eaters should faint by the Way; nay, so
zealous are they in the Cause of <i>Bacchus</i>, that one of the Chief
among ’em has made a Vow never to say his Prayers ’till he has a Tavern
of <i>his own</i> in every Street in <i>London</i>, and in every
Market-Town in <i>England</i>. What may we then in Time expect? Since by
insensible Degrees, their Society is become so numerous and formidable,
that they are without Number; other Bodies have their Meetings, but
where can the Dumpling-Eaters assemble? what Place large enough to
contain ’em! The <i>Bank</i>, <i>India</i>, and <i>South-Sea</i>
Companies have their General Courts, the <i>Free-Masons</i> and the
<i>Gormogons</i> their Chapters; nay, our Friends

the <i>Quakers</i> have their Yearly Meetings. And who would imagine any
of these should be Dumpling-Eaters? But thus it is, the Dumpling-Eating
Doctrine has so far prevailed among ’em, that they eat not only
Dumplings, but <i>Puddings</i>, and those in no small Quantities.</p>

<p>The Dumpling is indeed, of more antient Institution, and of
<i>Foreign</i> Origin; but alas, what were those Dumplings? nothing but
a few Lentils sodden together, moisten’d and cemented with a little
seeth’d Fat, not much unlike our Gritt or Oatmeal Pudding; yet were they
of such Esteem among the ancient <i>Romans</i>, that a Statue was
erected to <i>Fulvius Agricola</i>, the first Inventor of these Lentil
Dumplings. How unlike the Gratitude shewn by the Publick to our Modern
Projectors!</p>

<p>The <i>Romans</i>, tho’ our Conquerors, found themselves much
out-done in Dumplings by our Fore-fathers; the <i>Roman</i> Dumplings
were no more to compare to those made by the <i>Britons</i>, than a
Stone-Dumpling is to a Marrow Pudding; tho’ indeed, the <i>British</i>
Dumpling at that time, was little better than what we call a
Stone-Dumpling, being no thing else but Flour and Water: But every
Generation growing wiser and wiser, the
<span class = "pagenum">(4)</span>
<a name = "dumpling_page4" id = "dumpling_page4"> </a>
<!-- png 18 -->
Project was improv’d, and Dumpling grew to be Pudding: One Projector
found Milk better than Water; another introduc’d Butter; some added
Marrow, others Plumbs; and some found out the Use of Sugar; so that, to
speak Truth, we know not where to fix the Genealogy or Chronology of any
of these Pudding Projectors, to the Reproach of our Historians, who eat
so much Pudding, yet have been so Ungrateful to the first Professors of
this most noble Science, as not to find ’em a Place in History.</p>

<p>The Invention of Eggs was merely accidental, two or three of which
having casually roll’d from off a Shelf into a Pudding which a good Wife
was making, she found herself under a Necessity either of throwing away
her Pudding, or letting the Eggs remain, but concluding from the
innocent Quality of the Eggs, that they would do no Hurt, if they did no
Good. She wisely jumbl’d ’em all together, after having carefully pick’d
out the Shells; the Consequence is easily imagined, the Pudding became a
Pudding of Puddings; and the Use of Eggs from thence took its Date. The
Woman was sent for to Court to make Puddings for King <i>John</i>, who
then sway’d the Scepter; and gain’d such Favour, that she was the making
of her whole Family. I&nbsp;cannot conclude

this Paragraph without owning, I&nbsp;received this important Part of
the History of Pudding from old Mr. <i>Lawrence</i> of
<i>Wilsden-Green</i>, the greatest Antiquary of the present Age.</p>

<p>From that Time the <i>English</i> became so famous for Puddings, that
they are call’d Pudding-Eaters all over the World, to this Day.</p>

<p>At her Demise, her Son was taken into Favour, and made the King’s
chief Cook; and so great was his Fame for Puddings, that he was call’d
<i>Jack Pudding</i> all over the Kingdom, tho’ in Truth, his real Name
was <i>John <ins class = "authcorr" title = "corrected by author from ‘Barnes’">Brand</ins></i>, as by the Records of the Kitchen you will
find: This <i>John <ins class = "authcorr" title = "corrected by author from ‘Barnes’">Brand</ins></i>, or <i>Jack-Pudding</i>, call him which
you please, the <i>French</i> have it <i>Jean Boudin</i>, for his Fame
had reached <i>France</i>, whose King would have given the World to have
had our <i>Jack</i> for his Pudding-Maker. This <i>Jack Pudding</i>,
I&nbsp;say, became yet a greater Favourite than his Mother, insomuch
that he had the King’s Ear as well as his Mouth at Command; for the
King, you must know, was a mighty Lover of Pudding; and <i>Jack</i>
fitted him to a Hair, he knew how to make the most of a Pudding; no
Pudding came amiss to him, he would make a Pudding

out of a Flint-stone, comparatively speaking. It is needless to
enumerate the many sorts of Pudding he made, such as Plain Pudding,
Plumb Pudding, Marrow Pudding, Oatmeal Pudding, Carrot Pudding,
Saucesage Pudding, Bread Pudding, Flower Pudding, Suet Pudding, and in
short, every Pudding but Quaking Pudding, which was solely invented by,
and took its Name from our Good Friends of the <i>Bull and Mouth</i>
before mentioned, notwithstanding the many Pretenders to that
Projection.</p>

<p>But what rais’d our Hero most in the Esteem of this Pudding-eating
Monarch, was his Second Edition of Pudding, he being the first that ever
invented the Art of Broiling Puddings, which he did to such Perfection,
and so much to the King’s likeing, (who had a mortal Aversion to Cold
Pudding,) that he thereupon instituted him Knight of the Gridiron, and
gave him a Gridiron of Gold, the Ensign of that Order, which he always
wore as a Mark of his Sovereign’s Favour; in short, <i>Jack Pudding</i>,
or Sir <i>John</i>, grew to be all in all with good King <i>John</i>; he
did nothing without him, they were Finger and Glove; and, if we may
believe Tradition, our very good Friend had no small Hand in the
<i>Magna Charta</i>. If so, how much are all <i>Englishmen</i> indebted
<span class = "pagenum">(7)</span>
<a name = "dumpling_page7" id = "dumpling_page7"> </a>
<!-- png 21 -->
to him? in what Repute ought the Order of the Gridiron to be, which was
instituted to do Honour to this Wonderful Man? But alas! how soon is
Merit forgot? how impudently do the Vulgar turn the most serious Things
into Ridicule, and mock the most solemn Trophies of Honour? for now
every Fool at a Fair, or Zany at a Mountebank’s Stage, is call’d <i>Jack
Pudding</i>, has a Gridiron at his Back, and a great Pair of Spectacles
at his Buttocks, to ridicule the most noble Order of the Gridiron. But
their Spectacles is a most ungrateful Reflection on the Memory of that
great Man, whose indefatigable Application to his Business, and deep
Study in that occult Science, rendred him Poreblind; to remedy which
Misfortune, he had always a ’Squire follow’d him, bearing a huge Pair of
Spectacles to saddle his Honour’s Nose, and supply his much-lamented
Defect of Sight. But whether such an Unhappiness did not deserve rather
Pity than Ridicule, I&nbsp;leave to the Determination of all good
Christians: I&nbsp;cannot but say, it raises my Indignation, when I see
these Paunch-gutted Fellows usurping the Title and Atchievements of my
dear Sir <i>John</i>, whose Memory I so much venerate, I&nbsp;cannot
always contain my self. I&nbsp;remember, to my Cost, I&nbsp;once carry’d
my Resentment a little
<span class = "pagenum">(8)</span>

farther than ordinary; in furiously assaulting one of those Rascals,
I&nbsp;tore the Gridiron from his Back, and the Spectacles from his
A&mdash;e; for which I was Apprehended, carried to Pye-powder Court, and
by that tremendous Bench, sentenc’d to most severe Pains and
Penalties.</p>

<p>This has indeed a little tam’d me, insomuch that I keep my Fingers to
my self, but at the same time let my Tongue run like a Devil: Forbear
vile Miscreants, cry I, where-e’er I meet these Wretches? forbear to
ascribe to your selves the Name and Honours of Sir <i>John Pudding</i>?
content your selves with being <i>Zanies</i>, <i>Pickled-Herrings</i>,
<i>Punchionellos</i>, but dare not scandalize the noble Name of
<i>Pudding</i>: Nor can I, notwithstanding the Clamours and Ill Usage of
the Vulgar, refrain bearing my Testimony against this manifest piece of
Injustice.</p>

<p>What Pity it is therefore, so noble an Order should be lost, or at
least neglected. We have had no Account of the real Knights of the
Gridiron, since they appeared under the fictitious Name of the
<i>Kit-Kat Club</i>: In their Possession was the very Gridiron of Gold
worn by Sir <i>John</i> himself; which Identical Gridiron dignified the

<p>What is become of the Gridiron, or of the Remains of that excellent

But to return to Sir <i>John</i>: The more his Wit engaged the King, the
more his Grandeur alarm’d his Enemies, who encreas’d with his Honours.
Not but the Courtiers caress’d him to a Man, as the first who had
brought Dumpling-eating to Perfection. King <i>John</i> himself lov’d
him entirely; being of <i>Cesar</i>’s Mind, that is, he had a natural
Antipathy against Meagre, Herring-gutted Wretches; he lov’d only
<i>Fat-headed Men, and such who slept o’ Nights</i>; and of such was his
whole Court compos’d. Now it was Sir <i>John</i>’s Method, every
<i>Sunday</i> Morning, to give the Courtiers a Breakfast, which
Breakfast was every Man his Dumpling and Cup of Wine; for you must know,
he
<span class = "pagenum">(10)</span>
<a name = "dumpling_page10" id = "dumpling_page10"> </a>
<!-- png 24 -->
was Yeoman of the Wine-Cellar at the same time.</p>

<p>This was a great Eye-sore and Heart-burning to some Lubberly Abbots
who loung’d about the Court; they took it in great Dudgeon they were not
Invited, and stuck so close to his Skirts, that they never rested ’till
they Outed him. They told the King, who was naturally very Hasty, that
Sir <i>John</i> made-away with his Wine, and feasted his Paramours at
his Expence; and not only so, but that they were forming a Design
against his Life, which they in Conscience ought to discover: That Sir
<i>John</i> was not only an Heretic, but an Heathen; nay worse, they
fear’d he was a Witch, and that he had bewitcht His Majesty into that
unaccountable Fondness for a <i>Pudding-Maker</i>. They assur’d the
King, That on a <i>Sunday</i> Morning, instead of being at Mattins, he
and his Trigrimates got together Hum-jum, all snug, and perform’d many
Hellish and Diabolical Ceremonies. In short, they made the King believe
that the Moon was made of Green-Cheese: And to shew how the Innocent may
be Bely’d, and the best Intentions misrepresented, they told the King,
That He and his Associates offer’d Sacrifices to <i>Ceres</i>: When,
alas, it was only the Dumplings they eat.
<span class = "pagenum">(11)</span>

The Butter which was melted and pour’d over them, these vile Miscreants
call’d <i>Libations</i>: And the friendly Compotations of our
Dumpling-eaters, were call’d <i>Bacchanalian Rites</i>. Two or three
among ’em being sweet-tooth’d, wou’d strew a little Sugar over their
Dumplings; this was represented as an <i>Heathenish Offering</i>. In
short, not one Action of theirs, but what these Rascally Abbots made
Criminal, and never let the King alone ’till poor Sir <i>John</i> was
Discarded. Not but the King did it with the greatest Reluctance; but
they had made it a Religious Concern, and he cou’d not get off on’t.</p>

<p>But mark the Consequence: The King never enjoy’d himself after, nor
was it long before he was poison’d by a Monk at <i>Swineshead</i> Abbey.
Then too late he saw his Error; then he lamented the Loss of Sir
<i>John</i>; and in his latest Moments wou’d cry out, Oh! that I had
never parted from my dear <i>Jack Pudding</i>! Wou’d I had never left
off Pudding and Dumpling! I&nbsp;then had never been thus basely
Poison’d! never thus treacherously sent out of the World!<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Thus did this good King lament: But, alas,
to no Purpose, the Priest had given him his Bane, and Complaints were
ineffectual.</p>

<!-- png 26 -->
<p>Sir <i>John</i>, in the mean time, had retir’d into <i>Norfolk</i>,
where his diffusive Knowledge extended it self for the Good of the
County in general; and from that very Cause <i>Norfolk</i> has ever
since been so famous for Dumplings. He lamented the King’s Death to his
very last; and was so cautious of being poison’d by the Priests, that he
never touch’d a Wafer to the Day of his Death; And had it not been that
some of the less-designing part of the Clergy were his intimate Friends,
and eat daily of his Dumplings, he had doubtless been Made-away with;
but they stood in the Gap for him, for the sake of his Dumplings,
knowing that when Sir <i>John</i> was gone, they should never have the
like again.</p>

<p>But our facetious Knight was too free of his Talk to be long secure;
for a Hole was pick’d in his Coat in the succeeding Reign, and poor Sir
<i>John</i> had all his Goods and Chattels forfeited to the King’s Use.
It was then time for him to bestir himself; and away to Court he goes,
to recover his Lands, <i>&amp;c.</i> not doubting but he had Friends
there sufficient to carry his Cause.</p>

<p>But alas! how was he mistaken; not a Soul there knew him; the very
Porters
<span class = "pagenum">(13)</span>
<a name = "dumpling_page13" id = "dumpling_page13"> </a>
<!-- png 27 -->
used him rudely. In vain did he seek for Access to the King, to
vindicate his Conduct. In vain did he claim Acquaintance with the Lords
of the Court; and reap up old Civilities, to remind ’em of former
Kindness; the Pudding was eat, the Obligation was over: Which made Sir
<i>John</i> compose that excellent Proverb, <i>Not a word of the
Pudding</i>. And finding all Means ineffectual, he left the Court in a
great Pet; yet not without passing a severe Joke upon ’em, in his way,
which was this; He sent a Pudding to the King’s Table, under the Name of
a <i>Court-Pudding</i>, or <i>Promise-Pudding</i>. This Pudding he did
not fail to set off with large Encomiums; assuring the King, That
therein he wou’d find an Hieroglyphical Definition of Courtiers Promises
and Friendship.</p>

<p>This caused some Speculation; and the King’s Physician debarr’d the
King from tasting the Pudding, not knowing but that Sir <i>John</i> had
poison’d&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>But how great a Fit of Laughter ensu’d, may be easily guess’d, when
the Pudding was cut up, it prov’d only a large Bladder, just clos’d over
with Paste: The Bladder was full of Wind, and nothing else, excepting
these Verses written in a Roll of Paper,
<span class = "pagenum">(14)</span>
<a name = "dumpling_page14" id = "dumpling_page14"> </a>
<!-- png 28 -->
and put in, as is suppos’d, before the Bladder was blown full:</p>

<div class = "verse boldf">

</div>

<p>This Adventure met with various Constructions from those at Table:
Some Laugh’d; others Frown’d. But the King took the Joke by the right

<p>The Verses, tho’ but scurvy ones in themselves, yet in those Days
pass’d for tolerable: Nay, the King was mightily pleas’d with ’em, and
play’d ’em off on his Courtiers as Occasion serv’d; he wou’d stop ’em
short in the middle of a flattering Harangue, and cry, <i>Not a Word of
the Pudding</i>. This wou’d daunt and mortify ’em to the last degree;
they curs’d Sir <i>John</i> a thousand times over for the Proverb’s
sake: but to
<span class = "pagenum">(15)</span>
<a name = "dumpling_page15" id = "dumpling_page15"> </a>
<!-- png 29 -->
no Purpose; for the King gave him a private Hearing: In which he so well
satisfy’d His Majesty of his Innocence and Integrity, that all his Lands
were restor’d. The King wou’d have put him in his old Post; but he
modestly declin’d it, but at the same time presented His Majesty with a
Book of most excellent Receipts for all kinds of Puddings: Which Book
His Majesty receiv’d with all imaginable Kindness, and kept it among his
greatest Rarities.</p>

<p>But yet, as the best Instructions, tho’ never so strictly followed,
may not be always as successfully executed, so not one of the King<ins
class = "correction" title = "’ invisible">’s</ins> Cooks cou’d make a
Pudding like Sir <i>John</i>; nay, tho’ he made a Pudding before their
Eyes, yet they out of the very same Materials could not do the like.
Which made his old Friends the Monks attribute it to Witchcraft, and it
was currently reported the Devil was his Helper. But good King
<i>Harry</i> was not to be fobb’d off so; the Pudding was good, it sate
very well on his Stomach, and he eat very savourly, without the least
Remorse of Conscience.</p>

<p>In short, Sir <i>John</i> grew in Favour in spite of their Teeth: The
King lov’d a merry Joke; and Sir <i>John</i> had
<span class = "pagenum">(16)</span>
<a name = "dumpling_page16" id = "dumpling_page16"> </a>
<!-- png 30 -->
always his Budget full of Punns, Connundrums and Carrawitchets; not to
forgot the Quibbles and Fly-flaps he play’d against his Adversaries, at
which the King has laugh’d ’till his Sides crackt.</p>

<p>Sir <i>John</i>, tho’ he was no very great Scholar, yet had a happy
way of Expressing himself: He was a Man of the most Engaging Address,
and never fail’d to draw Attention: Plenty and Good-Nature smil’d in his
Face; his Muscles were never distorted with Anger or Contemplation, but
an eternal Smile drew up the Corners of his Mouth; his very Eyes
laugh’d; and as for his Chin it was three-double, a-down which hung a
goodly Whey-colour’d Beard shining with the Drippings of his Luxury; for
you must know he was a great Epicure, and had a very Sensible Mouth; he
thought nothing too-good for himself, all his Care was for his Belly;
and his Palate was so exquisite, that it was the perfect Standard of
Tasting. So that to him we owe all that is elegant in Eating: For
Pudding was not his only Talent, he was a great Virtuoso in all manner
of Eatables; and tho’ he might come short of <i>Lambert</i> for
Confectionary-Niceties, yet was he not inferiour to <i>Brawnd</i>,
<i>Lebec</i>, <i>Pede</i>, or any other great Masters of Cookery; he
could toss up a Fricassée as well as a Pancake:
<span class = "pagenum">(17)</span>
<span class = "folionum">D</span>
<a name = "dumpling_page17" id = "dumpling_page17"> </a>
<!-- png 31 -->
And most of the Kickshaws now in vogue, are but his Inventions, with
other Names; for what we call <i>Fricassées</i>, he call’d
<i>Pancakes</i>; as, a&nbsp;Pancake of Chickens, a&nbsp;Pancake of
Rabbets, <i>&amp;c.</i> Nay, the <i>French</i> call a Pudding an
<i>English</i> Fricassée, to this Day.</p>

<p>We value our selves mightily for Roasting a Hare with a Pudding in
its Belly; when alas he has roasted an Ox with a Pudding in his Belly.
There was no Man like him for Invention and Contrivance: And then for
Execution, he spar’d no Labour and Pains to compass his magnanimous
Designs.</p>

<p>O wou’d to Heav’n this little Attempt of Mine may stir up some
<i>Pudding-headed Antiquary</i> to dig his Way through all the mouldy
Records of Antiquity, and bring to Light the Noble Actions of Sir
<i>John</i>! It will not then be long before we see him on the Stage.
Sir <i>John Falstaffe</i> then will be a Shrimp to Sir <i>John
Pudding</i>, when rais’d from Oblivion and reanimated by the
All-Invigorating Pen of the Well-Fed, Well-Read, Well-Pay’d <i>C&mdash;

Memorandums, to remind ’em of the Gratitude due to Sir <i>John</i>’s
Memory.</p>

<p>On such a Subject I hope to see Sir <i>Richard</i> Out-do himself.
Nor <i>Arthur</i> nor <i>Eliza</i> shall with Sir <i>John</i> compare.
There is not so much <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘differenee’">difference</ins> between a Telescope and a Powder-Puff,
a&nbsp;Hoop-Petty-Coat and a Farthing-Candle, a&nbsp;Birch-Broom and a
Diamond-Ring, as there will be between the former Writings of this pair
of Poets and their Lucubrations on this Head.</p>

<p>Nor will it stop here: The <i>Opera</i> Composers shall have t’other
Contest, which shall best sing-forth his Praises. Sorry am I that
<i>Nicolino</i> is not here, he would have made an excellent Sir
<i>John</i>. But <i>Senefino</i>, being blown up after the manner that
Butchers blow Calves, may do well enough. From thence the Painters and
Print-sellers shall retail his goodly Phiz; and what <i>Sacheverel</i>
was, shall Sir <i>John Pudding</i> be; his Head shall hang Elate on
every Sign, his Fame shall ring in every Street, and <i>Cluer</i>’s
Press shall teem with Ballads to his Praise. This would be but Honour,
this would be but Gratitude, from a Generation so much indebted to so
Great a Man.</p>

<p>But how much do we deviate from Honour and Gratitude, when we put
other Names to his Inventions, and call ’em our own? What is a Tart,
a&nbsp;Pie, or a Pasty, but Meat or Fruit enclos’d in a Wall or Covering
of Pudding. What is a Cake, but a Bak’d Pudding; or a
<i>Christmas</i>-Pie, but a Minc’d-Meat-Pudding. As for Cheese-cakes,
Custards, Tansies, they are manifest Puddings, and all of Sir
<i>John</i>’s own Contrivance; for Custard is as old if not older than
<i>Magna Charta</i>. In short, Pudding is of the greatest Dignity and
Antiquity. Bread it self, which is the very Staff of Life, is, properly
speaking, a&nbsp;Bak’d Wheat-Pudding.</p>

<p>To the Satchel, which is the Pudding-Bag of Ingenuity, we are
indebted for the greatest Men in Church and State. All Arts and Sciences
owe their Original to Pudding or Dumpling. What is a Bag-Pipe, the
Mother of all Music, but a Pudding of Harmony. And what is Music it
self, but a Palatable Cookery of Sounds. To little Puddings or Bladders
of Colours we owe all the choice Originals of the Greatest Painters: And
indeed, what is Painting, but a well-spread Pudding, or Cookery of
Colours.</p>

<p>The Head of Man is like a Pudding: And whence have all Rhimes, Poems,
Plots and Inventions sprang, but from that same Pudding. What is Poetry,
but a Pudding of Words. The Physicians, tho’ they cry out so much
against Cooks and Cookery, yet are but Cooks themselves; with this
difference only, the Cooks Pudding lengthens Life, the Physicians
shortens it. So that we Live and Die by Pudding. For what is a Clyster,
but a Bag-Pudding; a&nbsp;Pill, but a Dumpling; or a Bolus, but a Tansy,
tho’ not altogether so Toothsome. In a word; Physick is only a
Puddingizing or Cookery of Drugs. The Law is but a Cookery of Quibbles
and Contentions.<a class = "tag" name = "taga" id = "taga" href =

<p>The Universe it self is but a Pudding of Elements. Empires, Kingdoms,
States and Republicks are but Puddings of People differently made
up.&nbsp;The Celestial and Terrestrial Orbs are decypher’d to us by a
pair of Globes or Mathematical Puddings.</p>

<p>The Success of War and Fate of Monarchies are entirely dependant on
Puddings and Dumplings: For what else are Cannon-Balls, but Military
Puddings; or Bullets, but Dumplings; only with this difference, they do
not sit so well on the Stomach as a good Marrow-Pudding or
Bread-Pudding.</p>

<p>In short, There is nothing valuable in Nature, but what, more or
less, has an Allusion to Pudding or Dumpling. Why then should they be
held in Disesteem? Why should Dumpling-Eating be ridicul’d, or
Dumpling-Eaters derided? Is it not Pleasant and Profitable? Is it not
Ancient and Honourable? Kings, Princes, and Potentates have in all Ages
been Lovers of Pudding. Is it not therefore
<span class = "pagenum">(22)</span>
<a name = "dumpling_page22" id = "dumpling_page22"> </a>
<!-- png 36 -->
of Royal Authority? Popes, Cardinals, Bishops, Priests and Deacons have,
Time out of Mind, been great Pudding-Eaters: Is it not therefore a Holy
and Religious Institution? Philosophers, Poets, and Learned Men in all
Faculties, Judges, Privy-Councellors, and Members of both Houses, have,
by their great Regard to Pudding, given a Sanction to it that nothing
can efface. Is it not therefore Ancient, Honourable, and
Commendable?</p>

<p class = "center">

<p>Why do therefore the Enemies of good Eating, the Starve-gutted
Authors of Grub-street, employ their impotent Pens against Pudding and
Pudding-headed, <i>aliàs</i> Honest Men? Why do they inveigh against
Dumpling-Eating which is the Life and Soul of Good-fellowship, and
Dumpling-Eaters who are the Ornaments of Civil Society.</p>

<p>But, alas! their Malice is their own Punishment. The Hireling Author
of a late scandalous Libel, intituled, <i>The Dumpling-Eaters
Downfall</i>, may, if he has any Eyes, now see his Error, in attacking
so Numerous, so August a Body of People: His Books remain Unsold,
Unread, Unregarded; while this Treatise of

Bookseller’s great Joy, and my no small Consolation. How shall I
Triumph, and how will that Mercenary Scribbler be Mortify’d, when I have
sold more Editions of my Books, than he has Copies of his!
I&nbsp;therefore exhort all People, Gentle and Simple, Men, Women and
Children, to Buy, to Read, to Extol these Labours of Mine, for the
Honour of Dumpling-Eating. Let them not fear to defend every Article;
for I will bear them Harmless: I&nbsp;have Arguments good store, and can
easily Confute, either Logically, Theologically, or Metaphysically, all
those who dare Oppose&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>Let not <i>Englishmen</i> therefore be asham’d of the Name of
<i>Pudding-Eaters</i>; but, on the contrary, let it be their Glory. For
let Foreigners cry out ne’er so much against Good Eating, they come
easily into it when they have been a little while in our <i>Land of
Canaan</i>; and there are very few Foreigners among as who have not
learn’d to make as great a Hole in a good Pudding or Sirloin of Beef as
the best <i>Englishman</i> of us all.</p>

Ridicul’d out of Good Living? Plots and Politics may hurt us, but
Pudding cannot. Let us therefore adhere to Pudding, and keep our selves
out of Harm’s Way; according to the Golden Rule laid down by a
celebrated Dumpling-Eater now defunct;</p>

of Mysteries the ingenious Mr. <em>E<span class =

such Proofs of his Abilities in his many and most elaborate Keys to

is uncomatable, but by the Fracture of its Shell, so is the Beauty of a
Mystery altogether hid, till the Expounder has riddlemayreed the
Propounder’s Problem, and render’d it obvious to the meanest
Capacity.</p>

<p class = "ital">
The only Plea I can use in Mr. <em>C<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>’s</em> behalf, is, that the Author of the
Dissertation has been a little too free with his Character, which
probably occasioned that Sullenness in our <em>British Oedipus</em>; who
in Order to be revenged, has determined not to embelish the Work with
his Interpretation, but rather let it rot and perish in Oblivion.</p>

<p class = "ital">
This, and nothing else, could be the Reason of so profound a Silence in
so great a Mysterymonger, to remedy which Loss to the Publick, I&nbsp;an
unworthy Scribler, and faint Copier of that great Artist, presume with
aching Heart, and trembling Hand, to draw the Veil which shades the
political Pamphlet in Question; and show it to my loving Countrymen in
<em>Puris Naturalibus</em>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
<span class = "folionum">B2</span>
<!-- png 55 -->
<p class = "ital">
If I succeed in this, I hope Mr. <em>L<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>t</em>, who all the World knows is a rare
Chap to his Authors, will speedily employ me to unriddle, or at least
make a Plot to the <em>Rival Modes</em>, which it seems the Author has
omitted: it is true, he ought to have given it the Bookseller with the
Copy, but has not so done, which makes me wonder he is not sued for
Breach of Covenant; but what is that to me, if I get a Job by the
Bargain? Let Booksellers beware how they buy Plays without Plots for the
future.</p>

<p class = "ital">
I narrowly miss’d solving the Problem called <em>Wagner</em> and
<em>Abericock</em>; Mr. <em>B<span class =

after having made me abate half my demand: But Houses running thin,
<em>Colley</em> had undertaken the Job himself to save Charges;
intending at the same Time, to annex a severe Criticism on
<em>Pluto</em> and <em>Proserpine</em>.</p>

<p class = "ital">
This, gentle Reader, will, I hope, induce you to look on me as a Writer
of some Regard, and at the same Time,
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
<!-- png 56 -->
to make a little Allowance for whatever Errors my great Hurry may
occasion, being obliged to write Night and Day, Sundays and working
Days, without the least Assistance. All our Journeymen Writers being now
turned Masters, I&nbsp;am left to shift for my self; but am bringing up
my Wife to the Business, and doubt not but a long War, and our mutual
Industry, may rub off old Scores, and make us begin a new Reckoning with
all Mankind; Pamphleteering having been so dead for many Years last
past, that (God forgive me!) I&nbsp;have been oftentimes tempted to
write Treason for mere Sustenance.</p>

<p class = "ital">
But Thanks to better Stars and better Days, the Pen revives, and Authors
flourish; more Money can be made now of a Play, nay, though it be a
scurvy One, than <em>Dryden</em> got by all his Works. Therefore now or
never is the Time to strike while the Iron is hot, to write my self out
of Debt, and into Place, and then grow idle and laugh at the World, as
my Betters have done before&nbsp;me.</p>

a&nbsp;Week after the Arrival of D<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>n&nbsp;<i>S<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>t</i>, from <i>Ireland</i>; the Occasion, as
I am very well informed, was this, the D<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>n, one of the first Things he did, went to
pay a Visit to Mr. <i>T<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span></i>,
his old Bookseller; but, to his Surprize, found both the Brothers dead,
and a Relation in the Shop, to whom he was an utter Stranger. Mr.
<i>M<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span></i> for such is this
Person’s Name, gathering from the D&mdash;n’s Enquiries who he was, paid
him his <i>Devoirs</i> in the most respectful Manner, solicited his
Friendship, and invited him to a Dinner, which the D<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>n&nbsp;was pleased to accept. By the Way,
you must know, he is a great Lover of Dumpling, as well as the
Bookseller, who had ordered one for himself, little dreaming of such a
Guest that Day. The Dinner, as ’twas not provided on purpose, was but a
Family one, well enough however for a Bookseller; that is to say,
a&nbsp;couple of Fowls, Bacon and Sprouts boiled, and a Forequarter
<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
<!-- png 59 -->
of Lamb roasted. After the usual Complements for the unexpected Honour,
and the old Apology of wishing it was better for his sake: The Maid,
silly Girl! came and asked her Master if he pleased to have his
Dumpling; he would have chid her, but the D<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>n&nbsp;mollified him, insisting at the same
Time, upon the Introduction of Dumpling, which accordingly was done.
Dumpling gave Cause of Conversation, but not till it was eat; for the
Reader must understand, that both the Gentlemen <ins class =
"correction" title = "text unchanged: error for ‘ply’?">play</ins>
a&nbsp;good Knife and Fork, and are too mannerly to talk with their
Mouths full. The Dumpling eat, as I said before, the D<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>n&nbsp;drank to the Bookseller, the
Bookseller to the Author, and with an obsequious Smile, seem’d to say
ah! Dear Doctor, you have been a Friend to my Predecessor, can you do
nothing for me? The D&mdash;n&nbsp;took the Hint, and after a profound
Contemplation, cry’d, Why ay&mdash;Dumpling will do&mdash;put
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
<!-- png 60 -->
me in Mind of Dumpling anon, but not a Word more at present, and good
Reason why, Dinner was coming in. So they past the rest of the Meal with
great Silence and Application, and no doubt dined well. Far otherwise
was it with me that Day: I&nbsp;remember to my Sorrow, I&nbsp;had a Hogs
Maw, without Salt or Mustard; <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘ha-/ing’ at line break">having</ins> at that Time, Credit with
the Pork-Woman, but not with the Chandler: Times are since mended,
<i>Amen</i> to the Continuance!</p>

<p>The D<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>n, having eat and
drank plentifully, began his usual Pleasantries, and made the Bookseller
measure his Ears with his Mouth; nay, burst his Sides with Laughter;
however, he found Interval enough to remind the D<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>n&nbsp;of Dumpling, who asked him if he had
a quick Hand at Writing: he excused himself, being naturally as Lazy as
the other was Indolent, so they contrived to ease themselves by sending
for a Hackney Writer
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
<span class = "folionum">C</span>
<!-- png 61 -->
out of <i>Temple Lane</i> to be the D&mdash;’s <i>Amanuensis</i>, while
he and his new Acquaintance crack’d t’other Bottle.</p>

<p>This Account may be depended upon, because I had it from the Man
himself, who scorns to tell a Lye.</p>

<p>To be short, my Friend had the worst of it, being kept to hard
Writing, without Drinking (Churls that they were) about three Hours; in
which Time the Dissertation was finished, that is to say, from Page 1.
to Page 25. the rest might probably be done at some other leisure Time,
to fill up the Chinks, but of that he knows nothing; sufficient is it
that the D<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>n&nbsp;was the
Author. Proceed we now to the other Discoveries, by drawing the Veil
from before the Book it self.</p>

which says, <i>What is better than a Pudding?</i> The Body owns its
Power, the Mind, its Delicacy; it will give Youth to grey Hairs, and
Life to the most Desponding: Therefore are
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<!-- png 64 -->
Pudding Eaters of great Use in State Affairs.</p>

<p>This Quotation is of a Piece with his Motto to the Tale of a Tub, and
other Writings; altogether Fictitious and Drole: he adds to the Jest, by
putting an Air of Authority or genuine Quotation from some great Author;
when alas! the whole is mere Farce and Invention.</p>

<p>The Dedication is one continued Sneer upon Authors, and their
Patrons, and seems to carry a Glance of Derision towards Men of Quality
in General; by setting a Cook above them, as a more useful Member in a
body Politick. Some will have this <i>Braund</i>, to be Sir ****, others
Sir
****, others Sir ****; but I take it to be more Railery than Mystery,
and that Mr. <i>Braund</i>, at the <i>Rummer</i> in <i>Queen-street</i>,
is the Person; who having pleas’d the Author in two or three
Entertainments, he, with a View truly <i>Epicurean</i>, constitutes him
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<!-- png 65 -->
his <i>Mæcenas</i>; as being more agreeable to him than a whole Circle
of Stars and Garters, of what Colour or Denomination soever.</p>

<p>In his Tale of a Tub, he has a fling at Dependance, and Attendance,
where he talks of a Body worn out with Poxes ill cured, and Shooes with
Dependance, and Attendance. Not having the Book by me, I&nbsp;am forced
to quote at Random, but I hope the courteous Reader will bear me out. He
complains of it again in this Treatise, and makes a Complement to Mr.
<i>Austin</i>, Mr. <i>Braund</i>’s late Servant; who keeps the
<i>Braund</i>’s Head in <i>New Bond-street</i>, near
<i>Hanover-Square</i>; a&nbsp;House of great Elegance, and where he used
frequently to dine.</p>

<p>The Distinction of <i>Brand</i>, <i>Braund</i>, and <i>Barnes</i>, is
a Banter on Criticks, and Genealogists, who make such a Pother about the
Orthography of Names and Things, that many Times, three Parts in four of
a Folio Treatise,
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<!-- png 66 -->
is taken up in ascertaining the Propriety of a Syllable, by which Means
the Reader is left undetermined; having nothing but the various Readings
on a single Word, and that probably, of small Importance.</p>

<p>I heartily wish some of these Glossographists would oblige the World
with a Folio Treatise or two, on the Word Rabbet: We shall then know
whether it is to be spelt with an <i>e</i>, or an <i>i</i>. For, to the
Shame of the <i>English</i> Tongue and this learned Age, our most
eminent Physicians, Surgeons, Anatomists and Men Midwives, have all been
to seek in this Affair.</p>

<p>The Master-Key to this Mystery, is the Explanation of its Terms; for
Example, by <i>Dumpling</i> is meant a Place, or any other Reward or
Encouragement. A&nbsp;<i>Pudding</i> signifies a P<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>t, and sometimes a C<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>tee. A&nbsp;<i>Dumpling Eater</i>, is a
Dependant on the Court, or, in a Word, any one who will rather pocket an
Affront than be angry at a Tip in Time. A&nbsp;<i>Cook</i> is a Minister
of State. The <i>Epicurean</i> and <i>Peripatetic</i> Sects, are the two
Parties of <i>Whigg</i> and <i>Tory</i>, who both are greedy enough of
Dumpling.</p>

<p>The Author cannot forbear his old Sneer upon Foreigners, but says, in
his <a href = "#dumpling_page1">1st Page</a>, &ldquo;That finding it a Land of
Plenty, they wisely resolved never to go home again,&rdquo; and in <a href =
"#dumpling_page2">his 2d</a>, &ldquo;Nay, so zealous are they in the Cause of
<i>Bacchus</i>, that one of the Chief among them, made a Vow never to
say his Prayers till he has a

<p>By the Invention of <i>Eggs</i>, <a href =
"#dumpling_page4">Page&nbsp;4.</a> is meant Perquisites. &ldquo;He cannot
conclude a Paragraph in his <a href = "#dumpling_page5">5th
<i>Page</i></a>, without owning he received that important Part of the
History of Pudding, from old Mr. <i>Lawrence</i> of <i>Wilsden
Green</i>, the greatest Antiquary of the present Age.&rdquo;<!-- marginal, no
close quote --></p>

<p>This old <i>Lawrence</i> is a great Favourite of the D&mdash;s; he is
a facetious farmer, of above eighty Years of Age, now living at
<i>Wilsden Green</i>, near <i>Kilburn</i> in <i>Middlesex</i>, the most
rural Place I ever saw: exactly like the Wilds of <i>Ireland</i>. It was
here the D&mdash;n&nbsp;often retired <i>incog.</i> to amuse himself
with the Simplicity of the Place and People; where he got together all
that Rigmayroll of Childrens talk, which composes his <i>Namby
Pamby</i>. Old <i>Lawrence</i>
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<span class = "folionum">D</span>
<!-- png 69 -->
told me, the D&mdash;n&nbsp;has sate several Hours together to see the
Children play, with the greatest Pleasure in Life: The rest he learned
from the old Nurses thereabouts, of which there are a great many, with
whom he would go and smoke a Pipe frequently, and cordially; not in his
Clergyman’s Habit, but in a black Suit of Cloth Clothes, and without a
Rose in his Hat: Which made them conclude him to be a Presbyterian
Parson.</p>

<p>This Mention of old <i>Lawrence</i>, is in Ridicule to a certain
great Artist, who wrote a Treatise upon the Word <i>Connoisseur</i> (or
a Knower) and confesses himself to have been many Years at a loss for a
Word to express the Action of Knowing, till the great Mr. <i>Prior</i>
gave him Ease, by furnishing him with the Word <i>Connoissance</i>. Our
D&mdash;n&nbsp;had drawn a Drole, Parallel to this, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Boudineur</i>, a&nbsp;Pudding Pyeman; and <i>Boudinance</i>, the
making of
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<!-- png 70 -->
Pudding Pies: But several Men of Quality begging it off, it was, at
their Request, scratch’d out, but my Friend, the <i>Amanuensis</i>,
remembers particularly its being originally inserted.</p>

<p>If the Reader should ask, Who is that K&mdash; <i>John</i> mentioned
in the <a href = "#dumpling_page4">fourth Page</a>, and which I ought to
have taken in its Place. I&nbsp;beg leave to inform him, that by K.
<i>John</i> is meant the late Q. <span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, with whom the D&mdash; of <i>M<span class
= "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span></i> was many Years in such great Favour,
that he was nick named K. <i>John</i>; it was in that Part of the
Q&mdash;’s Reign, that Sir <i>John</i> Pudding, by whom is meant ****
<i>you know who</i>, came in Favour; it is true, the Name is odd, and
seems to carry an Air of Ridicule with it, but the Character given him
by this allegorical Writer, is that of an able Statesman, and an honest
Man.</p>

<p>And here, begging Mr. D&mdash;n’s Pardon, I cannot but think his Wit
has out run his Judgment; for he puts
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<span class = "folionum">D2</span>
<!-- png 71 -->
the Cart before the Horse, and begins at the latter Part of Sir ****
Administration: But this might be owing to too plentiful a Dinner, and
too much of the Creature. Be that as it will, I&nbsp;must follow my
Copy, and explain it as it lies. Proceed we therefore to the
Dissertation, <a href = "#dumpling_page6"><i>Page&nbsp;6.</i></a></p>

<p>&ldquo;But what rais’d our Hero most in the Esteem of this Pudding-eating
Monarch, was his second Edition of Pudding, he being the first that ever
invented the Art of broiling Puddings, which he did to such Perfection,
and so much to the King’s liking (who had a mortal Aversion to cold
Pudding) that he thereupon instituted him Knight of the Gridiron, and
gave him a Gridiron of Gold, the Ensign of that Order; which he always
wore as a Mark of his Sovereign’s Favour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If this does not mean the late Revival of an ancient Order of
Knighthood, I&nbsp;never will unriddle Mystery
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<!-- png 72 -->
more: To prove which, we need but cross over to the next Page, where he
tells us, &ldquo;Sir <i>John</i> had always a Squire, who followed him,
bearing a huge Pair of Spectacles to saddle his Honour’s Nose.&rdquo; <a href
= "#dumpling_page7"><i>Diss. Page&nbsp;7.</i></a></p>

<p>After this, he very severely runs upon those would-be Statesmen, who
put themselves in Competition with his Favourite, Sir ****, with whom he
became exceeding intimate, and almost inseperable, all the Time he was
in <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>The Story of the Kit Cat Club, <i>Dick Estcourt</i>, and <i>Jacob
Tonson</i>, is a mere Digression; and nothing more to the Purpose, than
that we may imagine it came uppermost. He returns to his Subject in his
<a href = "#dumpling_page9">9th <i>Page</i></a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it was Sir <i>John</i>’s Method, every <i>Sunday</i> Morning, to
give the Courtiers a Breakfast; which Breakfast was every Man his
Dumpling, and Cup of Wine: For you must know, he was Yeoman of the
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<!-- png 73 -->
Wine-Cellar at the same Time.&rdquo;<!-- marginal, no close quote --></p>

<p>The Breakfast is Sir *** Levee, the Yeomanship of the Wine-Cellar, is
the ***.</p>

<p>The Author of the Dissertation, is a very bad Chronologist; for at
<a href = "#dumpling_page10"><i>Page</i> 10.</a> we are obliged to go
back to the former Reign, where we shall find the lubberly Abbots
(<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>) the High Church Priests, misrepresenting Sir
<i>John</i>’s Actions, and never let the Q<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> alone, till poor Sir <i>John</i> was
discarded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was a great Eye-sore, and Heart-burning to some lubberly
Abbots, who lounged about the Court; they took it in great Dudgeon they
were not invited, and stuck so close to his Skirts, that they never
rested till they outed him. They told the King, who was naturally very
hasty, that Sir <i>John</i>, <ins class = "correction" title =
"hyphen in original">made-away</ins> with his Wine, and feasted his
<i>Paramours</i> at his Expence; and not only so, but they were
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<!-- png 74 -->
forming a Design against his Life, which they in Conscience ought to
discover: That Sir <i>John</i> was not only an Heretic, but an Heathen;
nay, worse, they fear’d he was a Witch, and that he had bewitch’d his
Majesty into that unaccountable Fondness for a <i>Pudding-Maker</i>.
They assured the King, that on a <i>Sunday</i> Morning, instead of being
at Mattins, he and his Trigrimates got together hum jum, all snug, and
perform’d many hellish and diabolical Ceremonies. In short, they made
the King believe that the Moon was made of Green-Cheese: And to shew how
the Innocent may be bely’d, and the best Intentions misrepresented, they
told the King, That he and his Associates offered Sacrifices to
<i>Ceres</i>: When, alas, it was only the Dumplings they eat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Butter which was melted and poured over them, these vile
Miscreants, called <i>Libations</i>: And the
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>

friendly Compotations of our Dumpling Eaters, were called
<i>Bacchanalian Rites</i>. Two or three among them being sweet tooth’d,
would strew a little Sugar over their Dumplings; this was represented as
an <i>Heathenish Offering</i>. In short, not one Action of theirs, but
which these rascally Abbots made criminal, and never let the King alone
till Sir <i>John</i> was discarded; not but the King did it with the
greatest Reluctance; but they made it a religious Concern, and he could
not get off on’t.&rdquo;<!-- marginal, no close quote --> <a href =

<p>All the World knows that the <i>Tory</i> Ministry got uppermost, for
the four last Years of the Queen’s Reign, and by their unaccountable
Management, teaz’d that good Lady out of her Life: Which occasion’d the
D&mdash;n&nbsp;in his <a href = "#dumpling_page11">eleventh Page</a> to
say; &ldquo;Then too late he saw his Error; then he lamented the Loss of Sir
<i>John</i>; and in his latest Moments, would cry out, Oh!
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<!-- png 76 -->
that I had never parted from my dear <i>Jack-Pudding</i>! Would I had
never left off Pudding and Dumpling! then I had never been thus basely
poison’d! never thus treacherously sent out of the World!<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Thus did this good King lament: But alas! to
no purpose, the Priest had given him his Bane, and Complaints were
ineffectual.&rdquo;<!-- marginal, no close quote --></p>

<p>This alludes to Sir **** Imprisonment and Disgrace in the Year <span
class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Nay, so barefaced is the
D&mdash;n&nbsp;in his Allegory, that he tells us, in his <a href =
"#dumpling_page12">12th Page</a>, <i>Norfolk</i> was his Asylum. This is
as plain as the Nose on a Man’s Face! The subsequent Pages are an exact
Description of the Ingratitude of Courtiers; and his Fable of the
<i>Court Pudding</i>, <a href = "#dumpling_page13">Page&nbsp;13.</a> is
the best Part of the whole Dissertation.</p>

<p>One would imagine the D&mdash;n had been at Sea, by his writing
Catharping-Fashion, and dodging the Story sometimes Twenty-Years
backwards,
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<span class = "folionum">E</span>
<!-- png 77 -->
at other Times advancing as many; so that one knows not where to have
him: for in his <a href = "#dumpling_page15">fifteenth Page</a>, he
returns to the present Scene of Action, and brings his Hero into the
Favour of K<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> <i>Harry</i>,
<i>alias</i> **** who being sensible of his Abilities, restores him into
Favour, and makes Use of his admirable Skill in Cookery, <i>alias</i>
State Affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not one of the King’s Cooks could make a Pudding like Sir
<i>John</i>; nay, though he made a Pudding before their Eyes, yet they,
out of the very same Materials, could not do the like: Which made his
old Friends, the Monks, attribute it to Witchcraft and it was currently
reported the Devil was his Helper. But good King <i>Harry</i> was not to
be fobb’d off so; the Pudding was good, it sat very well on his Stomach,
and he eat very savourly, without the least Remorse of Conscience.&rdquo;
<a href = "#dumpling_page15"><i>Diss. Page</i>&nbsp;15</a>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
<!-- png 78 -->
<p>This seems to hint at the Opposition Sir **** met with from the
contrary Party, and how sensible the K<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> was, that they were all unable to hold the
Staff in Competition with him.</p>

<p>After this the D&mdash;n runs into a whimsical Description of his
Heroes personal Virtues; but draws the Picture too much <i>Alla
Carraccatura</i>, and is, in my Opinion, not only a little too familiar,
but wide of his Subject. For begging his Deanship’s Pardon, he mightily
betrays his Judgment, when he says, Sir <i>John</i> was no very great
Scholar, whereas all Men of Learning allow him to be a most excellent
one; but as we may suppose he grew pretty warm by this Time with the
Booksellers Wine, he got into his old Knack of Raillery, and begins to
run upon all Mankind: In this Mood he falls upon <i>C<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> J<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>n</i>, and Sir <i>R<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Bl<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>re</i>, a&nbsp;pair of twin Poets, who
suck’d one and the same Muse. After
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<span class = "folionum">E2</span>
<!-- png 79 -->
this he has a Fling at <i>Handel</i>, <i>Bononcini</i> and
<i>Attilio</i>, the Opera Composers; and a severe Sneer on the late
High-Church Idol, <i>Sacheverel</i>. As for <i>Cluer</i>, the Printer,
any Body that knows Music, or <i>Bow Church Yard</i>, needs no farther
Information.</p>

<p>And now he proceeds to a Digression, which is indeed the Dissertation
it self; proving all Arts and Sciences to owe their Origin and Existence
to <i>Pudding</i> and <i>Dumpling</i> (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>) Encouragement.
His <i>Hiatus</i> in the <a href = "#dumpling_page20">20th Page</a>,
I&nbsp;could, but dare not Decypher.</p>

<p>In his <a href = "#dumpling_page22">22nd Page</a>, he lashes the
Authors who oppose the Government; such as the <i>Craftsman</i>,
<i>Occasional Writer</i>, and other Scribblers, past, present, and to
come. <i>The Dumpling-Eaters Downfal</i>, is a Title of his own
Imagination; I&nbsp;have run over all <i>Wilford</i>’s Catalogues, and
see no Mention made of such a Book: All that Paragraph therefore is a
mere Piece of Rablaiscism.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<!-- png 80 -->
<p>In his <a href = "#dumpling_page23">23d Page</a>, he has another
confounded Fling at Foreigners; and after having determinately dubb’d
his Hero, the Prince of Statesmen, he concludes his Dissertation with a
Mess of Drollery, and goes off in a Laugh.</p>

<p>In a Word, the whole Dissertation seems calculated to ingratiate the
D&mdash;n&nbsp;in Sir **** Favour; he draws the Picture of an able and
an honest Minister, painful in his Countries Service, and beloved by his
Prince; yet oftentimes misrepresented and bely’d: Nay, sometimes on the
Brink of Ruin, but always Conqueror. The Fears, the Jealousies, the
Misrepresentations of an enraged and disappointed Party, give him no
small Uneasiness to see the Ingratitude of some Men, the Folly of
others, who shall believe black to be white, because prejudiced and
designing Knaves alarm ’em with false Fears. We see every Action
misconstrued, and Evil made out of Good; but as the best
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<!-- png 81 -->
Persons and Things are subject to Scandal and Ridicule; so have they the
Pleasure of Triumphing in the Truth, which always will prevail.</p>

<p>I take the Allegory of this Dissertation to be partly Historical,
partly Prophetical; the D&mdash;n&nbsp;seeming to have carried his View,
not only to the present, but even, succeeding Times. He sets his Hero
down at last in Peace, Plenty, and a happy Retirement, not unrelented by
his Prince; his Honesty apparent, his Enemies baffled and confounded,
and his Measures made the Standard of good Government; and a Pattern for
all just Ministers to follow.</p>

<p>Thus, gentle Reader, have I, at the Expence of these poor Brains,
crack’d this thick Shell, and given thee the Kernel. If any should
object, and say this Exposition is a Contradiction to the D&mdash;n’s
Principles; I&nbsp;assure such Objector, that the D&mdash;n&nbsp;is an
errant <i>Whig</i> by Education, and Choice: He may indeed cajole the
<i>Tories</i>
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<!-- png 82 -->
with a Belief that he is of their Party; but it is all a Joke, he is a
<i>Whig</i>, and I know him to be so; Nay more, I&nbsp;can prove it, and
defy him to contradict me; did he not just after his Arrival and
Promotion in <i>Ireland</i>, writing to one of his intimate Friends in
<i>London</i>, conclude his Letter in this Manner?</p>

<p class = "ital">
Thus Dear **** from all that has occur’d, you must conclude me a
<em>Tory</em> in every Thing, but my Principle, which is yet as unmoved,
as, that I&nbsp;am,</p>

<p class = "right">
Yours, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>This Letter, his Tale of a Tub, and in a Word, all his Invectives
against Enthusiasm and Priestcraft, plainly prove him to be no
<i>Tory</i>; and if his Intimacy, not only with Sir
**** himself, but most of the prime Men in the Ministry, cannot prove
him a <i>Whig</i>, I&nbsp;have no more to say.</p>

(see note to <i>Key</i>, p.&nbsp;17). On another level, the laziness

The &ldquo;Second Edition&rdquo; probably refers to the fact that the Order of the
Bath was reintroduced for Walpole’s benefit in June 1724. (See also
<i>Key</i>, p.&nbsp;19.) There is intentional confusion with Estcourt,
who as providore of the Beefsteak club wore about his neck a small
gridiron of silver and was made a Knight of Saint Lawrence. The Knights
of the Toast were an associated group.&nbsp;The gridiron is a symbol
both of gormandizing and of the roasting of Saint Lawrence.</td>
